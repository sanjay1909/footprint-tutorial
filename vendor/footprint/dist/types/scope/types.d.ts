/**
 * Scope Recorder Pattern - Type Definitions
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module defines the core types for the composable Scope system with
 * pluggable Recorders. The architecture follows a composition-over-inheritance
 * pattern where Recorders are attached to Scope instances to observe operations.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 *   - Recorder: A pluggable observer that receives notifications about scope operations
 *   - Events: Typed payloads passed to recorder hooks with operation context
 *   - Scope: The runtime memory container that stages read from and write to
 *
 * @module scope/types

 * Recorder interface - the contract for pluggable scope observers.
 *
 * All methods are optional to allow partial implementations. A recorder
 * can implement only the hooks it cares about (e.g., only onError for
 * error tracking, or only onStageStart/onStageEnd for timing).
 *
 * Recorders are invoked synchronously in attachment order. If a recorder
 * throws an error, it is caught and passed to onError hooks of other
 * recorders, but the scope operation continues normally.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Minimal recorder that only tracks errors
 * const errorTracker: Recorder = {
 *   id: 'error-tracker',
 *   onError(event) {
 *     console.error(`Error in ${event.stageName}:`, event.error);
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // Full recorder with all hooks
 * const fullRecorder: Recorder = {
 *   id: 'full-recorder',
 *   onRead(event) { ... },
 *   onWrite(event) { ... },
 *   onCommit(event) { ... },
 *   onError(event) { ... },
 *   onStageStart(event) { ... },
 *   onStageEnd(event) { ... },
 * };
 * ```
