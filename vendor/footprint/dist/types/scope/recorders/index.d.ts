/**
 * Scope Recorders - Barrel Export
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module provides a single entry point for all recorder-related exports.
 * Consumers can import everything they need from this location:
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import {
 *   Recorder,
 *   MetricRecorder,
 *   DebugRecorder,
 *   ReadEvent,
 *   WriteEvent,
 *   CommitEvent,
 *   ErrorEvent,
 *   StageEvent,
 *   RecorderContext,
 * } from './scope/recorders';
 * ```
 *
 * @module scope/recorders
 *
 * Requirements: 7.1 - Recorder interface is exported for consumer implementation
 */

 * Re-export the Recorder interface for consumer implementation.
 * Consumers can implement this interface to create custom domain-specific
 * recorders (e.g., LLMRecorder, APIRecorder).
 */

 * Re-export all event types for consumer use.
 * These types are passed to recorder hooks and provide context about
 * scope operations.

 * MetricRecorder - Production-focused recorder for timing and execution counts.
 * Tracks read/write/commit counts per stage and measures stage execution duration.
 */

 * DebugRecorder - Development-focused recorder for detailed debugging information.
 * Captures errors, mutations, and verbose logs for troubleshooting.
 */

/**
 * NarrativeRecorder - Captures per-stage scope reads/writes for narrative enrichment.
 * Bridges the gap between flow-level narrative (NarrativeGenerator) and data-level detail.
 * Produces structured per-stage data and text sentences that can be merged with
 * NarrativeGenerator output for the full picture: what happened AND what was produced.
