/**
 * types.ts
 *
 * WHY: Defines all types used by the executor module and its handlers.
 * This module centralizes type definitions to avoid circular dependencies
 * and provide a single source of truth for executor-related types.
 *
 * RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * - Define pipeline execution types (PipelineContext, PipelineStageFunction)
 * - Define streaming types (StreamCallback, StreamHandlers)
 * - Define subflow types (SubflowMountOptions, SubflowResult)
 * - Define extractor types (TraversalExtractor, StageSnapshot)
 * - Define flow control narrative types (FlowControlType, FlowMessage)
 *
 * DESIGN DECISIONS:
 * - Types are grouped by concern (subflow, streaming, extractor, etc.)
 * - Generic types use sensible defaults (TOut = any, TScope = any)
 * - Interfaces are preferred over type aliases for extensibility
 *
 * RELATED:
 * - {@link Pipeline} - Uses these types for execution
 * - {@link StageContext} - Referenced by StageSnapshot
 * - {@link PipelineRuntime} - Referenced by PipelineContext

/**
 * SubflowMountOptions
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Options for mounting a subflow via addSubFlowChart methods.
 *
 * WHY: Provides explicit data contracts between parent and subflow,
 * enabling the "Subflow = Pure Function" mental model.
 *
 * ## Mental Model: Subflow = Pure Function
 *
 * A **Subflow** behaves like a **pure function** in programming:
 * - Has its own isolated scope (local variables)
 * - Cannot access parent scope directly (no closure)
 * - Must receive inputs via parameters (`inputMapper`)
 * - Must return outputs via return value (`outputMapper`)
 *
 * DESIGN DECISIONS:
 * - Separation of Concerns: Subflow doesn't know about parent's scope structure
 * - Build-time Definition, Runtime Execution: Mappers defined at build time, executed at runtime
 * - Type Safety: TypeScript generics provide compile-time errors
 * - Testability: Subflows can be tested in isolation with mock inputs
 *
 * @template TParentScope - Type of the parent flow's scope
 * @template TSubflowInput - Type of the initial values for subflow scope
 * @template TSubflowOutput - Type of the subflow's final output
