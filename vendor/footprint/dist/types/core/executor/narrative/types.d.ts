/**
 * types.ts — Narrative Generation Interface
 *
 * WHY: Defines the contract that handlers call during pipeline traversal to
 * build a human-readable execution story. By coding to an interface, the
 * Pipeline can swap between a real NarrativeGenerator (when enabled) and a
 * NullNarrativeGenerator (when disabled) — the Null Object pattern gives
 * zero-cost narrative when consumers don't opt in.
 *
 * DESIGN: Each method maps 1-to-1 with a pipeline execution event. Handlers
 * call the method at traversal time (the richest context point) rather than
 * reconstructing narrative after the fact from FlowMessages. This keeps
 * sentence generation simple and execution-order guaranteed.
 *
 * RELATED:
 * - {@link NarrativeGenerator} - Active implementation that accumulates sentences
 * - {@link NullNarrativeGenerator} - No-op implementation for zero-cost disabled path
 * - {@link PipelineContext} - Holds the generator instance passed to handlers
 *
 * _Requirements: 9.2, 9.4_

/**
 * Contract for narrative generation during pipeline traversal.
 *
 * WHY: Provides a clear interface that handlers call to append human-readable
 * sentences to the narrative. Decouples sentence generation from execution
 * logic so the narrative module can be maintained and tested independently.
 *
 * DESIGN: Methods accept raw stage/branch names plus optional displayNames
 * and descriptions. The description field (set at build time on each stage)
 * is used to produce natural narrative sentences. When no description is
 * available, falls back to displayName then stageName.
 *
 * When narrative is disabled, the NullNarrativeGenerator satisfies this
 * interface with empty method bodies (zero allocation, zero string work).
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // During handler execution:
 * narrativeGenerator.onStageExecuted('validateInput', 'Validate Input', 'Validate the user input');
 * narrativeGenerator.onNext('validateInput', 'checkPerms', 'Check Permissions', 'Check user permissions');
 * narrativeGenerator.onDecision('roleCheck', 'admin', 'Grant Access', 'user role equals admin', 'Decide access level');
 *
 * // After execution:
 * const story = narrativeGenerator.getSentences();
 * // → [
 * //   "The process began: Validate the user input.",
 * //   "Next step: Check user permissions.",
 * //   "It decided access level: user role equals admin, so it chose Grant Access."
 * // ]
 * ```
